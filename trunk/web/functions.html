      <h1>RPMREBUILD features</h1>
      
      <h2>resume</h2>
      
      rpmrebuild is a tool to build an RPM file from a package that has already been installed<br />
      <br />
      (On debian, the equivalent product is dpkg-repack)
      <hr />
      
      <h2>use</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>since release 0.5, it should work on any linux distribution using rpm.</li>
	<li>basic rpmrebuild use do not require any rpm building knowledge</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>rebuild a lost rpm</h3>
      
      It was my first goal : I wanted to a batch rebuild of rpm file from the rpm database, in
      case of lost files. Command : <em>rpmrebuild package_name</em> 
      
      <h3>build a modified rpm</h3>
      
      You have an installed package, you have customised (configuration ...) and want to
      distribute this one : just use rpmrebuild to build a new rpm ( no need to know anything about rpm building) !
      Command : <em>rpmrebuild package_name</em> 
      
      <h3>advices</h3>
      
      <ul>
	<li>rpmrebuild do not need explicitly to be run on root superuser, but you you have to be root if some files are root-protected (600)</li>
	
	<li>the specfile is deleted after use. If you want to keep it, use -s option</li>
	
	<li>the rpm files are build on "natural" location (for example, on Redhat, on /usr/src/redhat/RPMS, by default).<br />
	but you may change this with -d option or with ~/.rpmmacros file (add "%_topdir your_dir")</li>
	
	<li>rpmrebuild has numerous options, check them with <em>man rpmrebuild</em> or <em>rpmrebuild --help</em></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>any other way</h3>
      I know there is an "repackage" option in recent rpm releases, but it is not convenient, as you
      have to uninstall the package ...<br />
      (not always possible, because of dependencies)
