    rpmrebuild is a tool to build an RPM file from a package that has already been installed <BR><BR>
    
    <H2>use</H2>
    since release 0.5, it should work on any distribution.
    
    <H3>rebuild a lost rpm</H3>
    It was my first goal : I wanted to rebuild an rpm file from the rpm database, in case of lost files
    
    <H3>build a modified rpm</H3>
    You have an installed package, you have customized (configuration ...) and want to distribute this one : just use rpmrebuild
    to build a new rpm ( no need to know anything about rpm building) !
    
    <H2>advices</H2>
    <UL>
      <LI>rpmrebuild do not need explicitely to be run on root superuser, but you you have to be root if some files are root-protected (600)</LI>
      <LI>the specfile is deleted after use. If you want to keep it, use -s option</LI>
      <LI>the rpm files are builded on "natural" location (for exemple, on redhat, on /usr/src/redhat/RPMS, by default).<BR>
      but you may change this with -d option or with ~/.rpmmacros file (add "%_rpmdir your_dir")</LI>
    </UL> 
    
    <H2>history</H2>
    I am system admin on linux, and I am using <A href="http://www.rpm.org">rpm</A> packages to help managing softwares.<BR>
    I install all the software in rpm, even if must convert tar.gz to rpm 
    (with <A href="http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">alien</A>, 
    <A href="http://www.npsnet.com/danf/software/">autospec</A>
    software).<BR>
    But I do not find an easy way to build an rpm file from the rpm database.<BR>
    <BR>
    this can be usefull on "old" distributions, because one can only find "recent" versions on the net (rmpfind).<BR>
    2 exemples : 
    
    <UL>
      <LI>want to reproduce a config from one pc to another one, and you do not have the rpm files any more ...</LI>
      
      <LI>want to test a new release, and go back if it does not work (how to re-install ?)</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <BR> 
    All the informations for the rpm file are in the rpm database (version, depends, install script ...), but there is no simple
    command, so I write a shell script to do this work for my personnal use. As I think it may be useful for others, I now
    want to put on the net. 
    
    <BR><BR>
    I know there is an "repackage" option in recent rpm releases, but it is not convenient, as you have to uninstall the package ...
