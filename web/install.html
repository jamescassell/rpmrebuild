    <H1 align=center>rpmrebuild's install</H1>
    
    As rpmrebuild is designed to work with rpm, it is packaged in rpm format.
    
    <H2>which package to choose</H2>
    <UL>
      <LI>rpm4.noarch.rpm : is for current linux distributions, which use rpm 4.x releases</LI>
      <LI>rpm3.noarch.rpm : is for very old linux distributions, which still use rpm 3.x releases</LI>
    </UL> 
    
    <H2>check packages</H2> 
    all the rpm packages are signed with my <A href="gpg.asc">gpg key</A>, so you should verify them with <CODE>rpm -K rpmrebuild*.rpm</CODE>
    
    <H2>how to install</H2>
    It is coded in shell script, so it does not depends from an os architecture or libraries, and should install anywhere with the following command : <CODE>rpm -Uvh rpmrebuild-{version}.noarch.rpm</CODE>
    
    <H2>what if dependencies problem occurs</H2>
    <UL>
      <LI>you can try to build your own package from src.rpm, with the following command :<CODE>rpmbuild --rebuild rpmrebuild-{version}.src.rpm</CODE>, then install the rpmrebuild-{version}.noarch.rpm file</LI>
      <LI>send a <A href=support.html">bug report</A></LI>
    </UL>
