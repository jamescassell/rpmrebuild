error: No compatible architectures found for build
<a>
It occurs, for example, when you have a linux distribution on 64 bits, and try
to rebuild a 32 bit package. A way to solve the problem is ito use the -e option, 
to edit the spec file and remove the 'BuildArch' tag; then continue the build, it should works.
