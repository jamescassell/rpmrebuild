    rpmrebuild is a tool to build an RPM file from a package that has already been installed<BR><BR>
    (On debian, the equivalent product is dpkg-repack)

    <UL>
      <LI>since release 0.5, it should work on any linux distribution using rpm.</LI>
      <LI>rpmrebuild use do not require any rpm building knowledge</LI>

    <H3>rebuild a lost rpm</H3>
    It was my first goal : I wanted to a batch rebuild of rpm file from the rpm database, in case of lost files.
    
    <H3>build a modified rpm</H3>
    You have an installed package, you have customised (configuration ...) and want to distribute this one : just use rpmrebuild
    to build a new rpm ( no need to know anything about rpm building) !
    
    <H3>advices</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI>rpmrebuild do not need explicitly to be run on root superuser, but you you have to be root if some files are root-protected (600)</LI>
      <LI>the specfile is deleted after use. If you want to keep it, use -s option</LI>
      <LI>the rpm files are build on "natural" location (for example, on Redhat, on /usr/src/redhat/RPMS, by default).<BR>
      but you may change this with -d option or with ~/.rpmmacros file (add "%_topdir your_dir")</LI>
      <LI>rpmrebuild as numerous options, check them with <EM>man rpmrebuild</EM> or <EM>rpmrebuild --help</EM></LI>
    </UL> 
    
    <H3>any other way</H3>
    I know there is an "repackage" option in recent rpm releases, but it is not convenient, as you have to uninstall the package ...<BR>
    (not always possible, because of dependencies)
