problem
-------
in some cases, rpmrebuild fails without error message

why
---
many pb are detected by return code test like : foo || return
but foo may not display any error message

answer
------
the idea is to write something like :
foo || Error " ..." || return


Error output will follow the template : 
file: (function) message
